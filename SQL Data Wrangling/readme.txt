Data wrangling and analysis for an imaginary online store.
Written by Mohsen Soliman, using MySQL workbench.

I wrote this sql file to practice and apply the techniques I've learned form:
Data Wrangling, Analysis and AB Testing with SQL, Coursera.

Tasks:
Task 1: Pull a list of user email addresses, but only for non-deleted users.
Task 2: Use the items table to count the number of items for sale in each category.
TASK 3: Select all of the columns from the result when you JOIN the users table to the orders.
Task 4: Count the number of viewed_item events.
Task 5: Compute the number of items in the items table which have been ordered.
Task 6: For each user figure out if a user has ordered something, and when their first purchase was.
Task 7: Figure out what percent of users have ever viewed the user profile page.
Task 8: How many new users are added each day?
Task 9: Count the number of users deleted each day. Then count the number of users removed due to merging in a similar way.
Task 10: Create a subtable of orders per day.
Task 11: Create a subtable of orders per week.
Task 12: create a subtable to send users an email about the item they viewed more recently.
Task 13: Find the average time between orders.
